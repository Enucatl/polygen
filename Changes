PolyGen - What's new?
---------------------

* 28/6/2004
  - official release 1.0.6 (formers were 1.0 pre-releases)
  - just few bugfixes

* 17/9/2003
  - bufix update v1.0pre r5
  - some checkings (i.e. cyclic unfoldings detection) didn't work anymore in
    conjuction with the new label checker; new second phase checker written

* 9/9/2003
  - bugfix update v1.0pre r4
  - lock/unlock block didn't work; atomic rename of temporary file used instead

* 8/9/2003
  - first official pre-release v1.0 r3 (formers are internal only)
  - new language feature: keyword ":=" introduces strong bindings that
    generates only once the binding itself is performed
  - new language feature: subproductions (of any form) introduces now local
    nestable scopes; any series of weak as well as strong mutual
    recursive bindings may appear prior to subproduction body; scoping rules
    are static lexical
  - new language feature: EBNF-like iteration is supported suffixing a "+"
    to a subproduction (standard form only)
  - new language feature: keyword "," acts as infix delimeter for positional
    atoms within production; generation occurs selecting all i-th elements
  - lexical rules changed: ',' character is no more a terminal simbol; use
    quotings instead
  - the new grammar checker is now able to infer label groups for each
    production, follow selections and report top-level environment-free
    label groups
  - grammar checker improved: all destructive selections are now detected
    and exhaustively reported, leading label usage towards higher robustness
  - grammar checker changed: termination is checkable from start symbol only
  - grammar checker improved: useless unfoldings are detected
  - warning suppressed: simple recursions are no more detected (was nonsense)
  - preprocessor bufixed: permutated sequences used to be automatically
    unfolded within a prodution, leading to incosistent probability
    distribution; now a subproduction is created
  - many translations (either syntactical sugars or preprocessings) now are
    implemented by using local bindings and scopes
  - compiled grammar files are no more called status files; compiled grammar
    object files is more suitable
  - command line option "-nasty" is suppressed: autocompilation of source
    grammars is now performed automatically
  - command line option "-T" is suppressed
  - command line option "-t" now performs termination check and report of
    inferred label groups
  - new command line option -l allows top-level initialization of label
    environment; useful for global symbols requiring some label
  - command line option "-seed" prevents now shuffling but still compiles
    grammar source and produces a grammar object file
  - command line option "-g" renamed to "-pre"
  - compiled grammar object file loading and storing operations are now
    enclosed within a lock/unlock pair, allowing concurrent access
  - new error location system supports file name now
  - more robust and exhaustive I/O exception system
  - HOWTO-grm manual is from now on referred as the reference manual
  - documentation roughly updated in italian only: there might
    be some minor incosistencies
  - all known grammars have been modified and corrected according to new
    features
  - grammars are no more distributed within the program package

* 6/2/2003
  - unofficial release v0.8.1 on the website
  - more readable error position part within message
  - minor lexing improvement and more self-explainatory lexer and parser error
    messages
  - now warnings are grouped into levels (the lower, the higher gravity): new
    options -W and -pedantic activates respectively a certain level and all
    of them
  - grammar checker improved: any cyclic subgraph is now detected and
    circuit is printed within the error message; potential recursions are
    detected too as level-2 warnings
  - grammar checker reengineered in some parts due to complexity increase; it
    still is single-pass, though
  - minor I/O exception system improvement
  - HOWTO manuals updated
  - oroscopo.grm, photoshop.grm, rappaz.grm and piani.grm added to official
    grammar package

* 9/1/2003
  - unofficial release v0.8 on the website
  - language feature changed: unfolding is no more specified in curly brackets:
    now the > operator unfolds any unfoldable atom, i.e. non-terminals and
    any kind of subproduction
  - new language feature: specifying subproductions in curly brackets on
    a given sequence allows permutation between themselves
  - new language feature: subproductions in reverse-doubleangle brackets are
    unfolded in depth
  - new language feature: operator < locks the following atom as non-unfoldable
  - error/warning system improved: all messages now specify the position in the
    source file where the error/warning occured
  - grammar checker speed improved: results of subgraph checking are now cached
  - program now takes more than one source file and processes all of them
  - now option -g, -t, -T and -nasty does not conflict any more
  - HOWTO manuals updated
  - lotto.grm, annunci.grm, monte.grm added to official grammar package

* 9/12/2002
  - unofficial release v0.7.1 on the website
  - new language feature: backslash keyword capitalizes following terminal
  - Unix.umask was not implemented under Windows and an exception used to be
    rosen; now umask is no more invoked and, as a side effect, permission
    triplets for status files now are rw-r--r-- on Linux systems with ---w-w-
    default umask
  - now status file is closed after laoding, cause storing open_out used to
    fail under some Windows
  - HOWTO manuals updated
  - filippi.grm, prov.grm, ponti.grm added to offical grammar package

* 5/12/2002
  - unofficial release v0.7 on the website
  - new and much more powerful preprocessor unfolding system
  - new language feature: productions in curly brackets are unfolded as if they
    were specified flat at the very level of the sequence containing them
  - language feature improvement: unfolding operator for non-terminal symbols
    may now appear as any atom within a sequence
  - all official grammars updated and exploit new features, resulting in
    less ad-hoc grouping tricks and dramatic raising of output quality in
    conjunction with nasty mode
  - more robust status file format: now contains version field for detecting
    compatibility and original grammar timestamp field for more reliable
    comparison
  - verbose mode even more verbose and informatory
  - HOWTO manuals updated
  - new delonghi.grm added to offical grammar package

* 27/11/2002
  - unofficial release v0.6.1 on the website
  - a lexical conflict previor used to cause troubles wherever a subproduction
    in round brackets followed the standalone dot operator: now it is
    no more mistaken for the multiselection syntactical sugar
  - lexical rules changed: now the underscore char cannot belong anymore to
    terminals, non-terminals and labels
  - all official grammars updated according to the new rules
  - ms.grm improved
  - status file is now created with rw-rw-rw- permission triplets
  - nasty mode now fails on error accessing status file instead of falling back
    to normal mode
  - more robust and self-explainatory I/O exceptions

* 22/11/2002
  - unofficial release v0.6 on the website
  - new option -v activates verbose mode
  - new option -nasty allows the program to store (and reload) the status file
    of a grammar, which represents the annotated absyn tree used by the
    generator and the shuffler: this way, multiple launches of the program
    produce etherogeneous output as if the -X option was used
  - now arguments are checked for conflicts
  - new README.win32 for MSWin users claiming known bugs or lacks of the win32
    executable due to OCaml compiler/library system incosistencies

* 20/11/2002
  - unofficial release v0.5 on the website
  - HOWTO-grm rewritten in HTML
  - neweconomy.grm renamed to manager.grm
  - topgirl.grm renamed to teen.grm
  - new b-film.grm, fiera.grm and genio.grm added to official grammar package
  - further checker improvement:
       (EE) overriding of non-terminal symbols
            epsilon-productions for both destructive label selection
              and actual epsilon terms
  - language feature improvement: selections are now nestable and there can be
    more than one active label; standalone dot operator now empties the list
    of active labels
  - further shuffling+random algorithm improvement: now probability weights
    are given to branches and more-chosen as well as less-chosen ones
    may be selected - this leads to much better results e.g. in loops
  - new option -eof specifies string to be used as end of output

* xx/10-11/2002
  - www.polygen.org website under construction
  - release-keeping stuff written: README, License, Credits, etc. files
  - major checker improvement - now things are really getting serious:
       (EE) existence of non-terminal symbols
            cyclic recursions
            recursive unfoldings
       (WW) potential epsilon-productions
            undefinition of non-termianl symbol "I'"
  - support for two checking levels: the former starts from "S" (or specified
    start sym) and explores grammar in depth; the latter iterates in-depth
    exploration for all non-terminal syms
  - new options -t and -T for check-only launches
  - new option -o specifies output file

* 14/10/2002
  - unofficial release v0.4
  - directory tree restructured: now grammars are collected by language and
    source code lies on a subdir
  - HOWTO-grm extended and translated into english as well
  - bio.grm and neweconomy.grm translated into english
  - new ms.grm and pythonizer.grm (english only) added to official grammar
    package; epigrafi.grm and recensioni.grm (italian only) too
  - source code restyling: checker and generator now stand on separate
    files and modules
  - added fairly simple recursive unfolding detection to the checker
  - new language feature: labels and selection (dot operator)
  - new shuffling+random algorithm for more etherogeneous output: now generator
    keeps track of explored path and selects among unchosen (or least chosen)
    branches only
  - epsilon term added (underscore keyword) to the absyn
  - now the optional subproduction is no more a term in the absyn and has been
    replaced by a syntactical sugar: [P] ==> (_ | P)
  - now the concatenation operator is a standalone term in the absyn and is no
    more handled as a special terminal symbol
  - conventional "I" non-terminal sym specifies grammar information string
  - new option -S allows specification of a starting non-terminal symbol other
    than "S"
  - new option -info stands for "-S I"
  - new options -ps and -seed allow output of and control over random seed
  - new option -X for iterating generation several times and exploiting the
    shuffling algorithm

* ...I've been on holyday =;D

* 21/7/2002
  - unofficial release v0.2
  - new language feature: unfolding operator
  - new preprocessing phase does the unfoldings
  - absyn has been doubled: the former is both output of the parser

    and input of the generator

* 20/7/2002
  - new tormentoni.grm (dedicated to Sergio) added to official grammar package
